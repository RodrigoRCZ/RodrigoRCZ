# Hi there! <img src="icons/Hi.gif" width="35" /> I'm Rodrigo Rodrigues

I am an undergraduate student in Computer Science at the [University of SÃ£o Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/). I'm currently part of **[Zenith Aerospace](https://github.com/zenitheesc)**, working with Computer Vision, Software Development and Digital Image Processing. Trying to explore new technological concepts and take advantage of them to create cool stuffs :)
